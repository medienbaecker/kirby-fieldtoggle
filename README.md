# Kirby Fieldtoggle v2.5

This field lets panel users toggle the visibility of other fields.

## Installation

Simply put the folder into your `site/fields` folder and rename it to "fieldtoggle". Create the folder if you don't have one. You can also install it via the Kirby CLI.

## Coming from Fieldtoggle v1

If you installed version 1 of the Fieldtoggle field, some things have changed. The toggle field is no longer the foundation, but rather the radio field. That enables you to use custom labels and more than two toggles. You will have to update the blueprint after updating.

## Examples

### Image field

In this very simple example we're toggling the visibility of a single field.

![Show image](preview/showimage.gif?raw=true)

We can  use whatever number of options we want. For this example we'll stick with `yes` and `no`, though. Setting the options works exactly as it would with a regular radio field.
In the additional `show` and `hide` lists, we can show or hide fields for any of the defined options. In this case we want to show the field `imagefield` when `yes` is active and hide it when `no` is active.

````
imagetoggle:
  label:       Show image?
  type:        fieldtoggle
  options:
    yes:       "Yes"
    no:        "No"
  show:
    yes:       imagefield
  hide:
    no:        imagefield
imagefield:
  label:       Image
  type:        image
````

### Full day events

This use case is a little more complex, but also more reasonable.

![Multiple Days](preview/multidays.gif?raw=true)

This time we'll do the exact same thing, but show or hide multiple fields at the same time. When `Multiple days` is activated, both `start` and `end` are shown. When `Single day` is activated, only `day` is visible and `start` and `end` are hidden.

````
eventtype:
  label:       Event type
  type:        fieldtoggle
  options:
    multidays: Multiple days
    singleday: Single day
  show:
    multidays: start end
    singleday: day
  hide:
    multidays: day
    singleday: start end
day:
  label:       Day
  type:        date
start:
  label:       First day
  type:        date
  width:       1/2
end:
  label:       Last day
  type:        date
  width:       1/2
````

The value of the `multidays` field is still available, so you can use an `if/else` condition in your template and display different things like you would with a regular `radio` field.

````
<? if($page->eventtype() == "multidays"): ?>
  // Code for event lasting multiple days
<? else: ?>
  // Code for event on a single day
<? endif ?>
````

### A fieldtoggle in a structure field

The `fieldtoggle` field works in structure fields, too.

![Structure](preview/structure.gif?raw=true)

This time, we'll have a lot of options to choose from. Depending on the category of the product, fields will be shown or hidden. Just have a look at the blueprint yourself. It may be a bit longer, but it's pretty self explanatory:

````
products:
  label:              Products
  type:               structure
  modalsize:          large
  fields:
    name:
      label:          Product name
      type:           text
      width:          1/2
    price:
      label:          Price
      type:           text
      icon:           euro
      width:          1/2
    category:
      label:          Category
      type:           fieldtoggle

        - Bird
    diet:
      label:          Diet
      type:           textarea
      icon:           cutlery
    start:
      label:          First day
      type:           date
      width:          1/2
    end:
      label:          Last day
      type:           date
      width:          1/2
    date:
      label:          Date
      type:           date
    employee:
      label:          Responsible Employee
      type:           select
      options:
        - Lorena Ipsmann
        - Dolores Singh
        - Achmed al Consetecur
        - Ali Lipsing
    bestbefore:
      label:          Best before
      type:           date

## Additional comments

Fields with `required` set to `true` will be required, even if they're hidden. I added a localized warning for this case in version 2.1

![Required warning](preview/required.gif?raw=true)

As of version 2.3, Kirby converts every field name to lowercase in the panel. There's no differentiation between `fieldName` and `fieldname`. Thanks to LCD344 for testing that.
